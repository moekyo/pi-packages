[![Pi Package](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-Package-6366F1?style=flat)](https://pi.mariozechner.at/)

A [Pi](https://pi.mariozechner.at/) extension that improves compatibility with Anthropic Claude Pro/Max OAuth (i.e., your Claude subscription) while preserving Pi's normal Anthropic behavior.

## What It Does

Pi works great with Anthropic API keys out of the box.
This extension fills in the gaps for users who want to use their **Claude Pro or Max subscription** via OAuth instead.

It keeps everything you'd expect — the built-in `anthropic` provider, the full model list, API-key behavior, and the native `/login anthropic` flow — and layers on the compatibility fixes needed to make OAuth subscriptions work reliably.

Requests to non-Anthropic providers and plain API-key Anthropic requests pass through completely untouched — the extension only activates when it detects an Anthropic OAuth payload.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@gotgenes/pi-anthropic-auth
```

To try it without permanently installing:

```bash
pi -e npm:@gotgenes/pi-anthropic-auth
```

## Usage

1. Run `/login anthropic` as usual — Pi's native Anthropic login flow is preserved.
2. Select a Claude Pro/Max model and start chatting. The extension handles compatibility transparently.
3. API-key behavior is unaffected; the extension's changes apply only to OAuth sessions.

## Development

### Requirements

- `pnpm`
- a local `pi` installation
- Anthropic OAuth credentials configured through Pi

### Commands

```bash
pnpm install      # install dependencies
pnpm run check    # typecheck
pnpm test         # run tests
pnpm run build    # compile
```

### Load a Local Build

```bash
pi -e /absolute/path/to/pi-anthropic-auth/dist/index.js
```

### Debug Logging

Set `PI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_DEBUG` to enable structured debug logs from the OAuth shaping layer.

Modes:

- `PI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_DEBUG=all` — log all Anthropic OAuth shaping events
- `PI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_DEBUG=tool-use` — log only requests that include `tool_use`

Example:

```bash
PI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_DEBUG=tool-use \
pi \
  --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 \
  --no-session \
  --tools read,grep,find,ls \
  -e /absolute/path/to/pi-anthropic-auth/src/index.ts \
  -p "How many lines are in @AGENTS.md ?"
```
